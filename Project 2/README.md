This is the read me file for project 2. We have all of our code included in this folder labeled "Project 2." It additionally includes instructions on how to run our compiler. 


To run the compiler, sensure that the project "CompilerProject1" is in your current directory. 

We already created a make file that cleans and runs the compiler/parser. Copy and paste the follwoing commands to run the compiler. 

To clean the files:

``` bash
make clean

To run the compiler:

``` bash
make parser
